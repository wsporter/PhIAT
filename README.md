# PhIAT
The Phase Imaging Analysis Tool (PhIAT) is a series of scripts designed for analysis of mass measurements done via the Phase-Imaging Ion-Cyclotron-Resonance (PI-ICR) technique. Commissioned and developed for use at the TITAN facility at TRIUMF, PhIAT provides a user-friendly experience, where all interaction is with a graphical user interface (GUI) contained in PhIAT.m

It's highly suggested new users read through the documentation before usage, with PhIAT Documentation Automatic Fitting.pdf as the suggested starting point.

PhIAT requires the use of titan_data package, which can be downloaded here: https://bitbucket.org/ttriumfdaq/titan_data/src/master/. See the documentation for more information.

Any questions, comments, or concerns can be directed to Sam Porter (wporter@triumf.ca or wporter@nd.edu)
